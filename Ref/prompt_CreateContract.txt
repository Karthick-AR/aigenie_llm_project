Generate 2 legal Documents. One for Customer (AIGENIE). This should include master legal clauses to state that supplier(not just NAIDA all suppliers) should resolve incidents of High Risk within 1 day , medium risk within 5 days and Low risk within 30 days.generate another legal document for Supplier(NAIDA) where supplier mentions that he can oprovide service to customer to reoslve incidents of High Risk within 30 days, Medium Risk within 60 days and low risk within 90 days.Both documents cannot be of same format. NAIDA legal document should miss few basic legal clauses which is detrimental to AIGENIE. Give me a summary of legal clauses that was deliberately missed in NAIDA.
